<h2>I'm different.</h2>

<p>My background is weird. Let's just get that out of the way. If you are an 
employer or recruiter, you're may look at my resume and just have no way to 
parse it. I'm not listing a school because I've only taken classes at community 
colleges. I was a medical assistant at my mom's office for years before deciding 
to become a programmer. Before that, I worked as a picker at a warehouse. 
I get that this isn't a "story" that makes sense, unlike Joe Schmoe who knew 
he'd be an engineer at age 9 and went to Stanford and interned at Google.</p>

<p>So, let me try to clear this up.</p>

<p>I've been making programs (at first in QBASIC) and web pages since I was in 
junior high. I just didn't know anyone personally who programmed and I found 
the online programming culture extremely intimidating. I definitely didn't 
know any other young women who coded. </p>

<p>When I was a senior in high school, I took my school's only programming 
course, which was in Visual BASIC. I absolutely loved it, and quickly got to 
the point where my teacher couldn't help me learn any more. He encouraged me 
to try computer science in college.</p>

<p>Now, I am terrible at school. I was terrible then and I'm terrible now. 
Classes just constantly run either too fast or too slow and I am not someone 
who is motivated by grades. If I learned what I wanted/needed to learn, I just 
couldn't make myself care about an F. I realized even at age 17 that I was not 
going to succeed in college given this enormous character flaw, so I went to 
the cheapest college I could find, Potomac State College.</p>

<p>At Potomac State College, I took C++ instead of Visual Basic because that's
a more serious language. It was miserable. The teacher clearly didn't want to 
be there, and I was the only woman in a class full of men who had already 
know each other for years. My advisor was a jerk. I didn't fit in at all. </p>

<p>I decided computer science wasn't for me, and eventually left school and 
started working. But I kept programming and I kept making websites. One great 
thing about a mindless-drone-type job is that you have tons of brain energy 
for projects after work. 

<h2>Are you different?</h2>

<p>I want to work somewhere that understands and appreciates the value of my 
unique background and skillset. My experiences and skills complement those of 
more experienced programmers by adding a unique point of view. With the right 
team, I'll do extraordinary work.</p>
